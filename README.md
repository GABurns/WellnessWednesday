# Wonderful Wednesdays
A repository for sharing the code used to produce data visualizations for the PSI [Wonderful Wednesdays](https://github.com/VIS-SIG/Wonderful-Wednesdays) challenges. 

My reasons for working on [Wonderful Wednesdays](https://github.com/VIS-SIG/Wonderful-Wednesdays) are:
- Networking
- Upskill in new packages 📦 or methods
- Create a portfolio
- Actively participate in the R community 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
